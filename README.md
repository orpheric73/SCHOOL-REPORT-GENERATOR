# 📚 SCHOOL-REPORT-GENERATOR
# 📌 Overview
School Report Generator is a structured C program that manages academic data and automatically generates formatted RTF reports.
It supports:
- Multiple classes
- Multiple students per class
- Multiple subjects per student
- Weighted averages
- Automatic statistical analysis
- Folder and file generation

The project demonstrates advanced use of dynamic memory allocation, nested structures, and file system manipulation.
# ⚙️ Features

- Multi-student management
- Multi-subject system
- Weighted average calculation
- Subject validation system
- PASS / FAIL decision (≥ 12)
- Highest & lowest subject detection
- Highest & lowest student per class
- Automatic folder creation
- Automatic RTF report generation
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows/Linux)
# 🖥 Compilation
- Windows (MinGW)
   - gcc main.c -o report.exe
- Linux
   - gcc main.c -o report
# ▶ Execution
- Windows
    - report.exe
- Linux
    - ./report
# 🧮 Grading Rules
- Grades range: 0 – 20
- Subject validated if average ≥ 12
